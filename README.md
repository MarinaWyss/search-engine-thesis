This goal of this project is to determine if search engine queries can be used to forecast whether an individual will vote in an upcoming election, and if so, for which party. It builds on existing research through the use of individual-level data, a holistic view at all search activity vs. just a predefined list of keywords, and the ability to use text analysis to potentially augment the explanatory power of search queries.
